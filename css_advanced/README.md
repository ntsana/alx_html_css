# 🎨 CSS Design Implementation from Scratch  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project is focused on **building a fully styled website from scratch using only HTML and CSS**.  
It’s a hands-on way to apply everything I’ve learned about web design fundamentals — from structuring web pages with HTML to styling them effectively using CSS.  

The goal is to understand how to transform a plain HTML page into a visually appealing website without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this project, I’ll be able to confidently explain and demonstrate:  

- 💡 What CSS is and how it’s used to style web pages  
- 🎨 How to add style to HTML elements (inline, internal, and external)  
- 🏷️ What classes and selectors are, and how to use them effectively  
- ⚖️ How CSS specificity works and how to compute specificity values  
- 📦 The box model — margins, padding, borders, and content  
- 🌐 How browsers load and render web pages

## 🧠 Skills I’ll Develop  
Throughout this project, I’ll strengthen several **core front-end development skills**, including:  

- Writing clean, semantic **HTML structure**  
- Designing and styling pages with **CSS from scratch**  
- Understanding **the cascade, inheritance, and specificity**  
- Applying the **box model** for layout and spacing  
- Debugging and validating my work using the **W3C Validator**  
- Practicing **independent problem-solving and research**

## ⚙️ Project Requirements  
- All files must end with a **new line**  
- A **README.md** file (this one!) must be in the root directory  
- Use **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue, Node.js, etc.)  
- Code must be **W3C compliant** and validated using the **W3C Validator**

## 💡 Additional Notes  
This project encourages **experimentation and creativity**.  
I’m free to explore other tutorials and techniques as long as I stay within the project’s rules — no frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

I’ll take time to test different styles, layouts, and colors to see how CSS changes affect the look and feel of my webpage.

✅ A solid foundation in CSS design principles  
✅ A clean, responsive website built entirely from scratch  
✅ A deeper understanding of how browsers interpret and render CSS  
✅ More confidence in my ability to build beautiful web interfaces independently
